Angular provides many built-in tools to help scale out large JavaScript applications. 
Interceptors are one of the built-in tools for specifically handling HTTP requests at a global application level.

Often we want to enforce or apply behavior when receiving or sending HTTP requests within our application. Interceptors are a unique type of Angular Service that we can implement. 
Interceptors allow us to intercept incoming or outgoing HTTP requests using the HttpClient. 
By intercepting the HTTP request, we can modify or change the value of the request.
